    "1) First acquaint yourself with the program, and get yourself a \"free\" (hopefully not first!) look at how Python works. Understand that each of the four distributions are being fitted with a linear function (here called \"fit_p1\") and the results plotted. There are comments for most lines in the macro!\n",
